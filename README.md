MAC Address Changer

Description:
This repository contains a Python script for changing the MAC address of a network interface on Unix-like operating systems. Changing the MAC address can be a useful technique for various networking tasks and security purposes. The script utilizes the subprocess, optparse, and re modules to interact with the system's networking configuration and parse command-line arguments. With clear function definitions and intuitive command-line interface, users can easily specify the interface and the new MAC address they want to assign. The script then executes the necessary commands to effectuate the MAC address change, providing feedback on the success or failure of the operation.

Features:

- Changes the MAC address of a specified network interface
- Parses command-line arguments for specifying interface and new MAC address
- Retrieves and displays the current MAC address of the interface
- Verifies if the MAC address change was successful
- This tool can be a valuable addition to network administration and security toolkits, enabling users to manipulate MAC addresses efficiently and effectively.
